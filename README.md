# Notesbox

## What is this?

A full shop website for musical boxes, based on an exam from my University, in which the students had to desgin an object and persistence model. 

## Why?

Well, having 0 knowledge in UI design, and very limited in front- and back design and development, I thought that making use of an already existing and detailed project summary would do a good practice project. I am also learning Spring, so it is also the first time I'm using it for a "realistic" project.

## Where can I see the project deployed?

For now, it isn't finished, so I haven't deployed its backend and database _yet_. I'm planning on fully completing this project soon ©.

You can take a look [here](https://notesbox.netlify.app/), but I left no sample data nor loading screens _yet ©_.
